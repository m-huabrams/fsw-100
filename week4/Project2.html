<h1>History of Snakes</h1>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573685616112-29f124e498f0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1051&q=80">
<p class="pg13">Snake, (suborder Serpentes), also called serpent, any of more than 3,400 species of reptiles distinguished by their limbless condition and greatly elongated body and tail. Classified with lizards in the order Squamata, snakes represent a lizard that, over the course of evolution, has undergone structural reduction, simplification, and loss as well as specialization. All snakes lack external limbs, but not all legless reptiles are snakes. Certain burrowing lizards may have only front or hind limbs or be completely legless. Unlike lizards, snakes lack movable eyelids, which results in a continuous and often disconcerting stare. Snakes also lack external ear openings. Internally, they have lost the urinary bladder. The visceral organs are elongated, with reduction of the left member in relation to the right; the left lung is greatly reduced or even lost entirely. However, snakes possess increased numbers of vertebrae and have developed two novelties among vertebrates: a tracheal lung in the neck region and a venom-conducting system for subduing prey.</p>
<h1>Best Snakes For Pets</h1>
<p>The best snake pets are easy to care for, requiring infrequent feeding and cleaning. Any of these good pet snakes could be an appropriate pet for a child as long as an adult supervises the care, and the child can understand that snakes have to eat other whole animals. Some of the best snakes to have as pets are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Corn snakes are one of the best starter snake choices because of its docile temperament and relatively small size.</li>
    <li>Kingsnakes are another non-poisonous starter snake that stays under six feet and is known for being calm.</li>
    <li>Gopher snakes can be a bit larger than other starter snakes but they can be handled often.</li>
    <li>Milk snakes are a favorite beginner snake because of their brilliant coloring.</li>
    <li>Rat snakes are known for having a docile temperament and are active during the day.</li>
    <li>Garter snakes are great pets because they're one of the smallest snakes and are inexpensive to keep.</li>
    <li>Ball pythons are a popular exotic snake because they're smaller than other constrictors and generally easy to handle.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hunting</h1>
<p>Snakes also have forked tongues, which they flick in different directions to smell their surroundings. That lets them know when danger—or food—is nearby.</p>
<p>nakes have several other ways to detect a snack. Openings called pit holes in front of their eyes sense the heat given off by warm-blooded prey. And bones in their lower jaws pick up vibrations from rodents and other scurrying animals. When they do capture prey, snakes can eat animals up to three times bigger than their head is wide because their lower jaws unhinge from their upper jaws. Once in a snake’s mouth, the prey is held in place by teeth that face inward, trapping it there.</p>
<h1>Habits</h1>
<p>About once a month snakes shed their skin, a process called ecdysis that makes room for growth and gets rid of parasites. They rub against a tree branch or other object, then slither out of their skin head first, leaving it discarded inside-out.</p>
<p>Most snakes lay eggs, but some species—like sea snakes—give live birth to young. Very few snakes pay any attention to their eggs, with the exception of pythons, which incubate their eggs.</p>
<p>There are roughly a hundred snake species listed by the IUCN Red List as endangered, typically due to habitat loss from development.</p>
<p>Here’s a fact to make ophidiophobes feel uneasy: Five species of snakes can fly.</p>
